<p>
  <b>What is this project about?</b><br/><br/>
  @V1.0<br/><br/>
  -it is a very simple website made using html css<br/><br/>
  -I hardcoded my college timetable in it<br/><br/>
  -it compares the timetable time and system time<br/><br/>
  -and then shows which lecture is going on<br/><br/>
  -it also has buttons to join different lectures<br/>
