This is my first vanilla js project !
What is this website about ? 
<h3>v1.0
-it is a very simple website made using html css
-I hardcoded my college timetable in it
-it compares the timetable time and system time 
-and then shows which lecture is going on
-it also has buttons to join different lectures
